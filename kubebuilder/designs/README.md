Designs
=======

These are design documents for changes to Kubebuilder (and
cross-repository changes for related projects, like controller-runtime and
controller-tools). They exist to help document the design processes that
go into writing Kubebuilder, but may not be up-to-date (more below).

Not all changes to Kubebuilder need a design document -- only major ones.
Use your best judgement.

When submitting a design document, we encourage having written
a proof-of-concept, and it's perfectly acceptable to submit the
proof-of-concept PR simultaneously with the design document, as the
proof-of-concept process can help iron out wrinkles and can help with the
`Example` section of the template.

## Out-of-Date Designs

**Kubebuilder documentation (the [book](https://book.kubebuilder.io) and
the [GoDoc](https://pkg.go.dev/sigs.k8s.io/controller-runtime?tab=doc)) should be
considered the canonical, update-to-date reference and architectural
documentation** for Kubebuilder.

However, if you see an out-of-date design document, feel free to submit
a PR marking it as such, and add an addendum linking to issues documenting
why things changed.  For example:

```markdown

# Out of Date

This change is out of date.  It turns out curly braces a frustrating to
type, so we had to abandon functions entirely, and have users specify
custom functionality using strings of Common LISP instead.  See #000 for
more information.
```
